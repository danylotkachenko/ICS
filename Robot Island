{Program	: A robot is placed in the middle of the 11 by 11 island with the ability to take 1 meter steps to the}
{Outline 	  North, East, South and West. Program simulates 20 trials. The terrain has obstacles on it. Obstacles are static during all 20 simulations.}
{             However, each time a program is executed they randomize. Upon reaching the end of the island the robot dissappears.}
{             Program is written using two modes: graphics and text mode. Therefore it has two output screens.}
{             At the end of 20 trials a statistical analysis is displayed.}
{             Program should not be stopped while executing. If it is stopped and then compiled again an error occurs "Error while linking".}
